# Best XI Selection from 2023 World Cup

## Project Overview

This project aims to identify and select the top 11 players from the 2023 World Cup who would make the best team. The selection is based on specific parameters tailored to form a balanced and competitive team. The final selection includes:

- **Openers**: 2 players
- **Anchors**: 3 players
- **Finisher**: 1 player
- **All-rounders**: 2 players
- **Fast bowlers**: 3 players

## Steps Followed

### 1. Parameter Selection for Victory
Identified key performance indicators (KPIs) crucial for team success in the World Cup. These parameters include batting averages, strike rates, bowling economy rates, and fielding statistics among others.

### 2. Data Collection
Gathered comprehensive data from all matches in the 2023 World Cup. The dataset includes player statistics, match outcomes, and other relevant performance metrics.

### 3. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Processed the raw data to remove inconsistencies and inaccuracies. This step involved handling missing values, correcting data formats, and ensuring uniformity across the dataset.

### 4. Data Transformation Using Power Query
Leveraged Power Query to transform the cleaned data into a more analyzable format. This step involved merging tables, creating calculated columns, and applying necessary data transformations to facilitate analysis.

### 5. Data Modeling and Building Parameters Using DAX
Used Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create sophisticated models and metrics. This involved calculating advanced performance metrics and modeling player contributions to team success.

### 6. Building Visuals and Dashboard
Developed a comprehensive dashboard to visualize the analysis. The dashboard includes various charts and tables that display player performance metrics and comparisons.

### 7. Selecting the Final 11
Based on the analysis, selected the top 11 players who fit the defined roles and parameters to form the best possible team.
